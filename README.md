# Machine Learning Guides
(I'll be moving this over to the Fractal Github as guides are completed)

This is a repository for Fractal machine learning guides. The intention is to provide a structured learning process from beginner concepts all the way to more advanced concepts, all in one place. In this repository you can find guides about the following concepts:
- Neural Network Introduction
- Deep Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- More to come!

In addition there will be links to more external resources in each section

## Suggested Order
Before going too deep into the guides in this repository, it is suggested that you familiarize yourself with the more fundamental topics covered in the IntroGuides repository. These topics include Command line basics, Git, Editors and IDEs, Python, Anaconda, and several more. For this repository the suggested order is the following:
- Introductory topics
- Deep Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks

For each section, you don't have to look through everything. If you feel comfortable with the topics or want to keep pushing forward to challenge yourself, you can continue on to the next section. Additionally, if you find that topics aren't making sense to you, be sure to check out YouTube or StackOverflow for answers. There are probably many people struggling with the same problem you're having!
